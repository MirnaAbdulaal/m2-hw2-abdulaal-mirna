        <h2>My interests</h2>
    <p>My name is Mirna Abdulaal and my interests include communications and finding ways to help governments to effectively communicate their message. I am also really passionate about creative writing, and I believe that journalism is a powerful force in bringing voice to the voiceless. One of my favourite hobbies is horse riding, as I love the connection and emotion I experience with my horse. As a senior writer in Egyptian Streets, my writings can be found here: <a href="www.egyptianstreets.com">egyptianstreets</a> My writings usually revolve around three main topics, as mentioned below:</p>
    <ol start= "1"

        <li>Culture</li>
        <li>Spirituality</li>
