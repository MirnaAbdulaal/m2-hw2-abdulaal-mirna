        <h1>My interests</h1>
    <p>My name is Mirna Abdulaal and my interests include communications and finding ways to help governments to effectively communicate their message. I am also really passionate about creative writing, and I believe that journalism is a powerful force in bringing voice to the voiceless. One of my favourite hobbies is horse riding, as I love the connection and emotion I experience with my horse. One of the projects that I worked on was the Ministry of International Cooperation in Egypt's website, which can be found here: <a href="www.moic.gov.eg">Moic</a></p>
